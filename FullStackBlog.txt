Abstract
Blog, in full Web log or Weblog, online journal where an individual, group, or corporation presents a record of activities, thoughts, or beliefs. Some blogs operate mainly as news filters, collecting various online sources and adding short comments and Internet links.
Blog is a communication tool that plays a key role in a web application. Use of blogs has resulted in a paradigm shift in the way a web application interacts with the customer.
A blog app can make your posts more easily accessible. Instead of loading your blog URL, users can simply find your latest content on the app. An app will also make it easier for users to share your content with others.
During the development of web application, there is a need to elicit and specify the requirements for the blogging functionality. 
In this we present a some requirements for the blog, from the perspective of integrating the blog in a web application.

Design Of the Project
Goal :  

The purpose of a blog is to create a more engaging website for your brand. Along with using your website to teach users about your products and services, you can also include a blog section to teach consumers about topics that are relevant to your field. We used ReactJs to design frontend because of its fast user interface.

WHY did we choose this project?
The project is a real world case and would be helpful for further projects to be taken up from customers who wish to use it for their marketing purpose and increase the reach of their brand.

The database connected to it would help the servicemen to better analyze their customer’s behaviour and enhance and improve their shop on the basis of that conclusion.
